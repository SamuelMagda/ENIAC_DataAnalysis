# MySQL & Tableau - #DTS23

## First DATA Science project @ WBS Coding School

### Indroduction
The project theme was to analyze a companies database in order to conclude if it is a good business partner for a market expansion.
The data was analyzed and presented by a group of 3 people (me and other 2 colleagues) using MySQL, Tableau and Google Slides.


## **_ENIACs expansion in Brazil_**
**Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories.**
It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries and is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market.

**Magist** is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. In addition, Magist provides after-sales services such as stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service related to the shipment.


ENIAC has two main concerns:
1. Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories.
**It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.**
2. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key.
The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? **Are deliveries fast enough?**


The project answers to **Three main **business questions****:
Whenever you feel ready for it, go through the questions below. Note that in many cases, you will have to translate business terms into tables, columns and aggregations. Whenever needed, make your own educated guesses or assumptions (e.g. what can be considered a “tech” or an “expensive” product).

**3.1. In relation to the products:**
- What categories of tech products does Magist have?
- How many products of these tech categories have been sold (within the time window of the database snapshot)? What percentage does that represent from the overall number of products sold?
- What’s the average price of the products being sold?
- Are expensive tech products popular? *

**3.2. In relation to the sellers:**
- How many months of data are included in the magist database?
- How many sellers are there? How many Tech sellers are there? What percentage of overall sellers are Tech sellers?
- What is the total amount earned by all sellers? What is the total amount earned by all Tech sellers?
- Can you work out the average monthly income of all sellers? Can you work out the average monthly income of Tech sellers?
  
**3.3. In relation to the delivery time:**
- What’s the average time between the order being placed and the product being delivered?
- How many orders are delivered on time vs orders delivered with a delay?
- Is there any pattern for delayed orders, e.g. big products being delayed more often?

The approach for answering the bussiness questions begines with detailed data analysis to uncover key insights. 
These insights then guide the responses to important business questions, ensuring that the strategies are well-informed and effective.

The compressed answers to this questions are found in the following presentation:
