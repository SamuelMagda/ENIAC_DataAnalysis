# ENIAC – Market Expansion Analysis (MySQL & Tableau)

Business data analysis project developed during the Data Science program at **WBS Coding School**, exploring the potential partnership between **ENIAC**, a European tech accessories retailer, and **MAGIST**, a Brazilian e-commerce platform.

---

## Overview

The project aimed to assess whether **MAGIST** is a suitable logistics and marketplace partner for **ENIAC**’s expansion into Brazil.  
The analysis focused on sales performance, product portfolio compatibility, delivery times, and overall market viability.

---

## Key Objectives
1. Evaluate **MAGIST’s** product portfolio and overlap with Eniac’s tech-oriented catalog.  
2. Analyze **sales volume**, **pricing**, and **popularity** of technology products.  
3. Measure **delivery performance** and identify potential logistics risks.  
4. Provide data-driven insights and recommendations for expansion feasibility.

## Tools and Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **MySQL** | Data querying, cleaning, and business analysis |
| **Tableau** | Visualization of sales and delivery metrics |
| **Google Slides / PowerPoint** | Final business presentation |
| **SQL Workbench** | Query execution and dataset exploration |

---

## Data Insights

- **MAGIST** hosts over **32,951 products** in **75 categories**, but only **~11%** align with Eniac’s tech catalog.  
- **Average delivery time** for tech products: **13 days** (vs. 12 for all products).  
- **40% of deliveries** are delayed.  
- Despite low specialization, MAGIST has strong national coverage and low delivery costs.  

These findings suggest that while **MAGIST** has infrastructure advantages, it is **not optimized for premium tech product logistics**.

## Deliverables
- **SQL scripts** for product, sales, and logistics analysis (`Business_Questions.sql`, `Analysing_the_Data.sql`)  
- **Presentation deck:** [ENIAC’s Expansion in Brazil (Google Slides)](https://bit.ly/ENIACs-expansion)  
- **Business report** with comparative and financial conclusions
